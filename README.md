# Play with Compose

## Overview

```
This project contains a collection of several codelabs related to Jetpack Compose. 
Each branch is a codebase from a different project. Apart from that, 
each project has a tutorial that contains the project development process. 
So that it is expected to be able to help readers understand the development process of each project.
```

## Chapter
### Migrating Existing View
```
One of the great things about Compose is Interoperability with XML, 
so it's possible to have a compose component inside a ViewGroup. 
In this series I discuss the process of migrating View into Custom Widgets and embedding 
them into ViewGroups with ComposeView components. This series is perfect for starting to learn 
how to build UI with compose. There are 4 part : Compose Introduction, 
Setup Existing Project to Compose Migrate, Build Custom Widget, and Implementing ComposeView.
