# Play with Compose

## Overview

```
This project contains a collection of several codelabs related to Jetpack Compose. 
Each branch is a codebase from a different project. Apart from that, 
each project has a tutorial that contains the project development process. 
So that it is expected to be able to help readers understand the development process of each project.
```

## Chapter
### [Chapter 1] Migrating Existing View
```
One of the great things about Compose is Interoperability with XML, 
so it's possible to have a compose component inside a ViewGroup. 
In this series I discuss the process of migrating View into Custom Widgets and embedding 
them into ViewGroups with ComposeView components. This series is perfect for starting to learn 
how to build UI with compose. There are 4 part : Compose Introduction, 
Setup Existing Project to Compose Migrate, Build Custom Widget, and Implementing ComposeView.

### [Chapter 2] Basic Layout
```
Build UI with modern framework like Compose based on declarative paradigm
makes the UI building process easier and faster, because it is enough to describe
the desired appearance in a Composable Function which is written like a function 
and Compose will handle it behind the scenes. To make it easier to understand this concept, 
I write this article that specifically discuss about 3 basic components to Build Layout in Compose.

### [Chapter 3] Constraint Layout
```
ConstraintLayout is a layout manager that allows you to create complex layouts 
by defining constraints between views. In Compose, you can use ConstraintLayout 
to create layouts using a similar approach.
